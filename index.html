    <p class="title">OLD LOOK OF FARLIGHT 84</p>
    <br>
    <p class="sub-topic"> THE LAMPTON MAP</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class="home-image" src="images/lampton.jpg" alt="old farlight">

    <br>
    <br>
     <p class="text2"> The early versions of Farlight 84 were quite different from what we see today, offering a nostalgic experience for long-time players. The first maps, like Lampton, had a more straightforward layout, with wide-open spaces and fewer environmental hazards, giving players a raw, open-world feel. Lampton itself was a city-based map, but it featured more narrow streets, less verticality, and fewer hidden spots. Players had to rely heavily on basic combat and positioning in the middle of an intense firefight. The lack of modern updates meant fewer fast-paced mobility features, and this allowed for slower, more strategic battles where players could plan their movements more carefully.

    <p class="title">Old Heroes and Abilities</p>
    <br>
    <p class="sub-topic"> OLD HEORES</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class="home-image" src="images/old-heroes.jpg" alt="old farlight">
    <br>
    <br>
     <p class="text2"> Several heroes introduced early on didn't make it to the more recent updates. For example, Warden, who had a protective shield and defense-based abilities, was focused on holding down areas and providing support for teammates. Another was Maverick, whose abilities centered on mobility and quick attacks. While newer heroes are now more flexible and feature more complex kits, older heroes felt more niche and focused on particular playstyles, which encouraged teamwork and tactical planning over raw firepower.

    <p class="title">Old Jetpacks</p>
    <br>
    <p class="sub-topic">The reason why players play farlight before</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img class="home-image" src="images/jetpacks.jpg" alt="old farlight">
    <br>
    <br>
     <p class="text2"> The Jetpack was one of the most iconic mobility tools in the early days of Farlight 84. It had a limited fuel supply but offered significant verticality and allowed players to fly over terrain obstacles or escape intense combat situations. Back then, jetpacks were essential for creating height advantages, escaping from tight situations, or surprising enemies from above. The balance of fuel management and high-risk maneuvering made them an exciting feature, especially before the map's verticality started becoming more refined in later updates.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p class="text2"> The game’s earlier mechanics placed heavy emphasis on manual control and skill. The old jetpacks weren't as automated as they are now, meaning players had to carefully time their ascents and manage fuel usage strategically, making every flight decision crucial.
